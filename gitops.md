[GITOPS WITH WEAVE FLUX](https://eksworkshop.com/weave_flux/)

GitOps, a term coined by Weaveworks, is a way to do continuous delivery. Git is used as single source of truth for deploying into your cluster. This is easy for a development team as they are already familiar with git and do not need to know other tools. Weave Flux is a tool that runs in your Kubernetes cluster and implements changes based on monitoring Git and image repositories.
